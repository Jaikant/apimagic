Enter to submit and Shift + Enter for a newline represents the standard across most AI chat interfaces. This guide provides a detailed breakdown by provider, followed by insights into shortcut adoption patterns and their impact on user experience.

## Understanding the Standardization

The dominance of Enter for message submission reflects years of evolution in digital communication. This pattern emerged from early instant messaging platforms and now serves as the foundation for modern AI chatbot interfaces. Users expect this behavior, making deviation risky for platform adoption.

## Shortcut Table by Provider

| ------------------- | ------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| OpenAI ChatGPT      | Enter                                 | Shift + Enter   |
| Anthropic Claude    | Enter                                 | Shift + Enter   |

| Ctrl/Cmd + Enter → Send, Enter → New Line | Intercom Messenger                                                             | 1     |

## User Experience Implications

The widespread adoption of Enter for submission creates several advantages. Users develop muscle memory that transfers between platforms. Support teams face fewer confusion reports about message sending. New users onboard faster due to familiar interaction patterns.

Intercom's deviation serves a specific purpose. Customer service scenarios often require longer, formatted messages. Their approach prioritizes message composition over quick submission, reflecting different user needs in business communication contexts.

## Platform Design Considerations

The Enter-to-send pattern works well for conversational AI because most interactions involve single questions or short prompts. The Shift + Enter escape hatch handles edge cases where users need multi-paragraph input without disrupting the primary workflow.

This design philosophy balances speed with flexibility, enabling both rapid-fire conversations and thoughtful, structured queries within the same interface.
